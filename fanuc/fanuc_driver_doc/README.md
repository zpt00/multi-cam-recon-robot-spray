## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html)
  (for virtual environment and dependency management)
- Git LFS (to track large assets)
- pre-commit (to enforce code style and checks)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FANUC-CORPORATION/fanuc_driver_doc.git
   cd fanuc_driver_doc
   ```

2. Initialize Git LFS

   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

3. Install dependencies with pipenv

   ```bash
   pipenv install
   ```

4. If your environment is using a version of Python higher than `3.10`, you can specify the target
   version as shown in the following example:

     ```bash
     pipenv --python 3.12 install
     ```

5. Activate the virtual environment

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

6. Install pre-commit hooks

   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Build the Documentation

- Build with multiversion support:

  ```bash
  sphinx-multiversion . _build/html
  cd _build/html
  python3 -m http.server 8000
  ```

  > :red_circle: **NOTE:** This method will require manual steps to rebuild and serve the site locally.

- Build without multiversion support:

  ```bash
  sphinx-autobuild . _build/html
  ```

  > This method will serve the site and provide auto-rebuild and with live-reloading.
